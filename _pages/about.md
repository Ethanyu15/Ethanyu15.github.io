I am an undergraduate student at [Southwest Petroleum University](https://www.swpu.edu.cn/),[Optoelectronic Information Science and Engineering](https://www.swpu.edu.cn/lxy/index.htm). My research interests include computer vision, computer graphics, metasurfaces and computational optics.

I am fortunate to be mentored by [Prof. Kai Wei](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0022160/) at the Autonomous Sensing Laboratory [College of Optoelectronic Science and Engineering](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/), Zhejiang University.
